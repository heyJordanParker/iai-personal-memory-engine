## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Opt-in int8 embedding quantization** via the `IAI_MCP_EMBED_QUANTIZE=int8` environment variable. The default `fp32` path is unchanged. Round-trip cosine similarity ≥ 0.99 on `bge-small-en-v1.5` in tests. New `Embedder.embed_quantized()` surface returns a `QuantizedVector` with per-vector `scale` and `zero_point` calibration.
- **Derived temporal validity**: `memory_recall` hits and anti-hits now carry `valid_from` and `valid_to` fields derived at recall time from the contradiction-edge graph. `valid_from` defaults to the record's `created_at`; `valid_to` is set only when a newer record contradicts it. Both default to `None` on paths that don't enrich (back-compat preserved).
- **MCP tool annotations and outputSchema** on every tool. Each tool now declares `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, and `title` annotations plus a structured `outputSchema`. Lifts Glama TDQS from C to B.
- **`BENCHMARKS.md`** — public methodology document covering the eight project benchmarks (M-01 token budget, M-02 latency, M-03 RSS, M-04 verbatim, M-05 trajectory, M-06 multilingual, M-07 session cost, M-08 LongMemEval-S).
- **Bench harness reliability**: `bench/longmemeval_blind.py` now supports `--resume` and `--fresh` flags, auto-cleans errored checkpoints by default, requires an explicit `IAI_MCP_STORE_PASSPHRASE` for the encrypted store, and classifies errored rows separately from genuine misses in the summary.
- **Codex CLI** as an optional `capture-hooks` target for ambient Stop-hook capture. New: `iai-mcp capture-hooks install --target codex|claude|all` and `iai-mcp capture-hooks status --target all`.
- README documents Claude Code and Codex setup paths for capture hooks and MCP wiring.

### Changed

- **Behavior — stale downweight on recall.** Records contradicted by a newer record are now downweighted (not hidden) in both `hits` and `anti_hits`. Score is multiplied by `STALE_DOWNWEIGHT_FACTOR`, and the `reason` field carries a ` · stale` suffix. Top-K ranking may shift compared to v0.1.0 — fresh lower-cosine records can outrank stale higher-cosine ones. Audit trail preserved (records are not removed).
- **API contract — deterministic `overnight_digest`.** The `overnight_digest` block in `memory_recall` responses is now deterministic: same inputs produce the same shape and field set. When no REM cycle has run, the digest is a zeroed default instead of a partial dict. Same top-level keys returned over both stdio and socket transports.
- **API contract — `camouflaging_status` outputSchema fields renamed** to match the actual Python response. `formality_trend` → `trajectory_slope`, `anomaly_score` → `current_mean`, plus new `sample_count: integer`. Permissive JSON Schema consumers were already tolerant; strict-validation consumers must update.

### Known fragile surfaces

- `IAI_MCP_EMBED_QUANTIZE` accepts only `int8` (lowercase) or unset. Any other value — including `INT8`, `int4`, or typos — causes the daemon to fail loud at startup with a `ValueError`. This is intentional; no silent fallback to `fp32`.
- New `valid_from` and `valid_to` keys in `hits[]` and `anti_hits[]` are additive (default `None`). Strict JSON Schema consumers that validate with `additionalProperties: false` will reject the response shape until they widen their schema.
- The `_knobs_applied` field is present in the `memory_recall` response but is not yet declared in the tool's `outputSchema`. Known debt; will be addressed in a follow-up release.
